# Climate Migration

Project with Carina M and Chris L

Contributors:
You should download everything and put it all in a separate project directory somewhere with nothing else in the directory. From there you can manage in whatever git ways you want to. 

If you make any changes that delete or remove anything please put it in an alternate branch! Clarity is key in multi-person coding projects.


Thanks
